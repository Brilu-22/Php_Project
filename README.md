## Website Concept

When we had the group meeting and we had a brainstorming session of the type of Q&A website we were trying to go for , we came to discussing how it would be great to have it as a type of social media platform and that's how the concept of Selah Encrypted. Religion Decrypted looking like TikTok,Twitter and Instagram came from.

## Development Process

### Important Notice

- Important thanks to the countless YouTubers and their videos that helped me reach this point of succession , @Coding Shiksha and countless others

### Succession Processes

- The intended functionality of the code works , even though there are some cracks it code produces the intended outcomes

### C.R.U.D Functionality

- Create - Users can create posts and comments.
- Read - The read functionality works at it's best , where read requests are given even though there seems to be some hiccups, but for the most part it words.
- Update - Users can update/edit profiles and change their user ids in the settings page.
- Delete - When it comes to the delete functionality, the code for the delete is there but unfortunately it's currently not working but the functionality "is there".

## Challenges

- main Challenge would have to be working with a different DBMS from last term so some things I had to learn again
- New DBMS = New Problems, The database kept on crashing and giving all sorts of errors , which consumed a lot of my time and productivity.
- Since it's also the first time I'm working with php at times my code would give some complicated and non-understandable errors ( still does , hence some of my functionality is screwed ).

## Future Solutions

- Take more time learning the database and language
- Don't take too much time with animations and making the website look cool
- Add the ability for all users to fully see everyones comment , and creating different communities for different topics to make it much easier for users to interact with the website.
- Also gsap isn't for everyone ( I learnt the hard and long way )
